### Steps:

```javascript
// Paste in console - Replace with your actual values:
// - Get APPS_SCRIPT_URL from Apps Script deployment (e.g., https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz.../exec)
// - Get API_KEY from your .env file (VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_API_KEY)

const APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec';
const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-from-env';

fetch(APPS_SCRIPT_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    apiKey: API_KEY,
    type: 'welcome',
    name: 'Rate Test',
    email: 'ratetest@example.com',
    appUrl: window.location.origin
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

### Expected Results:
- âœ… First 5 requests succeed (status: ok)

   ```
2. Wait for reminder to be sent

### Expected Results:
