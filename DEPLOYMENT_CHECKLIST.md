```

### **Step 4: Verify Existing Users**

   - [ ] Impact Score: Shows calculated value
4. [ ] Verify numbers are NOT zero (if user has approved submissions)
5. [ ] Verify numbers are stable (not changing continuously)

### **Step 5: Test New User**

**Create a brand new account:**

1. [ ] Sign up as new user
2. [ ] Complete onboarding
3. [ ] Go to Dashboard
4. [ ] Verify all stats are 0:
   - [ ] Projects: 0

   - [ ] Submit
2. [ ] As admin: Approve project
   - [ ] Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Submissions
   - [ ] Review the submission
   - [ ] Approve it
3. [ ] As user: Check Dashboard
   - [ ] Projects: 1
   - [ ] Hours: 10
   - [ ] Impact: 15 (10 + 5)
4. [ ] Verify stats updated in real-time (no refresh needed)

### **Step 7: Test Event Flow**

**Similar to project but for events:**

1. [ ] As user: Create new event
   - [ ] Fill all required fields
   - [ ] Set duration hours (e.g., 3 hours)
   - [ ] Submit
2. [ ] As admin: Approve event

| Feature | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| New User | Signup ‚Üí Dashboard | All stats = 0 | [ ] |
| Existing User | Login ‚Üí Dashboard | Stats show counts | [ ] |
| Create Project | Submit with 10hrs | Pending (stats = 0) | [ ] |

## Rollback Plan

### **If something goes wrong:**

**Option 1: Rollback Deployment**
```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
# Firebase:
firebase hosting:rollback

# Vercel:
vercel rollback [deployment-url]

# Netlify:
netlify deploy --alias previous-version
```

**Option 2: Emergency Fix**
```bash
# Make quick fix
# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
[deploy command]
```

**Option 3: Disable Feature**
```typescript
// In Dashboard.tsx, temporarily revert to old calculation
// Comment out new calculateUserStats
// Uncomment old version
// Redeploy
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Migration is NOT reversible, but it's safe - it only adds fields, doesn't delete or modify existing data.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to run migration multiple times?**  
A: No, run it once after deployment. It's idempotent (safe to run multiple times).

**Q: Will existing users lose their data?**  
A: No, migration only ADDS fields. No data is deleted or modified.

**Q: What if I forget to run migration?**  
A: Existing users' stats won't show correctly. Run it ASAP after deployment.

**Q: Can I edit stats manually?**  
A: Stats are calculated automatically. Edit source data (submissions) in Firestore instead.

**Q: How do I add a user to a project/event?**  
A: Edit the submission in Firestore, add user UID to participantIds/attendeeIds array.
