   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec h264 -acodec none -b:v 2M -vf scale=1920:1080 -preset slow output.mp4
   ```
3. Place in `/public/videos/` with appropriate name
4. Update `heroVideos` in `communityServiceAssets.ts` if needed

### Adding Images
1. Source high-quality community service photos (min 1200x800)
2. Optimize for web (JPEG/WebP, reasonable file size)
3. Place in `/public/community-service/` with descriptive name
4. Update `sectionImages` in `communityServiceAssets.ts` to reference

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Optimizations

### Loading Strategy
1. Page loads without delay (fallbacks if needed)
2. Videos preload poster images
3. Background images load after initial render
4. Smooth experience even on slow connections

When adding assets:
- **Authentic**: Use real community service photos/videos
- **Diverse**: Represent various demographics

- **High Quality**: Professional or high-quality amateur
- **Rights**: Ensure proper permissions/licenses

### Technical Guidelines
- Keep videos under 10MB each

- Test on mobile devices
