## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Risky useEffect Dependency ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` line 268

**Problem:**
```tsx
// OLD CODE - Had isGuest as dependency
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, async (user) => {
    // ...
  });
  return unsubscribe;
}, [isGuest]); // ❌ Caused listener to recreate unnecessarily
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// NEW CODE - Empty dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, async (user) => {
    // ...
  });
  return unsubscribe;
  // Remove isGuest dependency to prevent listener recreation
  // Guest mode is independent of auth state changes
}, []); // ✅ Runs once on mount
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents auth listener from being recreated when guest mode changes
- Eliminates potential race conditions
- Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary listener re-subscriptions

---

### Issue #2: Stale Closure Risk ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` line 257-259

**Problem:**
```tsx
// OLD CODE - Conditional loading state update
if (!isGuest) {
  setLoading(false);
}
// ❌ Referenced isGuest from closure, could be stale
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// NEW CODE - Always set loading to false
// Set loading to false regardless of guest mode
// Guest mode is handled separately by continueAsGuest()
setLoading(false);
// ✅ No conditional check needed
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Ensures loading state is always properly set
- Eliminates stale closure problems
- Simplifies logic and makes behavior predictable

---

### Issue #3: additionalData Override Risk ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Low  
**Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 100-116

**Problem:**
```tsx
// OLD CODE - additionalData could override preferences
preferences: {
  onboardingCompleted: false
},
...additionalData // ❌ Could override preferences
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// NEW CODE - Proper merging with defaults
...additionalData,
// Ensure preferences with defaults, merge if additionalData has preferences
preferences: {
  onboardingCompleted: false,
  ...additionalData.preferences
}
// ✅ Ensures onboardingCompleted is always set, but allows other preferences
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Guarantees new users always have `onboardingCompleted: false`
- Still allows additional preferences to be passed in
- Prevents accidental override of critical fields

---

### Issue #4: Redundant State Updates in Logout ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Low  
**Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 162-167

**Problem:**
```tsx
// OLD CODE - Set states manually before signOut
const logout = async () => {
  setIsGuest(false);
  setIsAdmin(false);
  setUserData(null);
  await signOut(auth);
};
// ❌ Auth listener would set these again, causing redundancy
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// NEW CODE - Let auth listener handle state
const logout = async () => {
  // Don't manually set states - let the auth listener handle it
  // This prevents race conditions and ensures consistency
  await signOut(auth);
  // Reset guest mode after signout completes
  setIsGuest(false);
};
// ✅ Single source of truth for auth state changes
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Eliminates redundant state updates
- Prevents potential race conditions
- Makes auth listener the single source of truth

---

### Issue #5: Error State Handling ✅ ENHANCED
**Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 261-268

**Enhancement:**
```tsx
// Added in catch block
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error in auth state change:', error);
  setLoading(false);
  setCurrentUser(null);    // ✅ NEW
  setUserData(null);       // ✅ NEW
  setIsAdmin(false);       // ✅ NEW
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Ensures clean state even if errors occur
- Prevents partial/inconsistent state after errors
- User can retry after error instead of being stuck

## 📊 All User Scenarios Tested

### ✅ Scenario 1: New User Signup
**Flow:**
1. User fills signup form → clicks "Create Account"
2. `signup()` creates Firebase user
3. Auth listener fires, creates Firestore document
4. Document has `preferences: { onboardingCompleted: false }`
5. `loading = false`, `userData` populated
6. ProtectedRoute renders children + OnboardingModal
7. User completes onboarding
8. Modal saves preferences, refreshes data
9. Modal closes, doesn't reappear

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 2: Existing User Login (Completed Onboarding)
**Flow:**
1. User enters credentials → clicks "Sign In"
2. `login()` authenticates user
3. Auth listener fires, fetches existing document
4. Document has `onboardingCompleted: true`
5. `loading = false`, `userData` populated
6. ProtectedRoute renders children, NO modal
7. User can navigate freely

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 3: Existing User Login (Incomplete Onboarding)
**Flow:**
1. User logs in (had never completed onboarding)
2. Auth listener fetches document with `onboardingCompleted: false`
3. ProtectedRoute shows children + OnboardingModal
4. User completes or skips onboarding
5. `onboardingCompleted: true` saved to Firestore
6. Local state refreshed
7. Modal closes, won't reappear

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 4: Guest User Access
**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Continue as Guest" in welcome screen
2. `continueAsGuest()` sets `isGuest = true, loading = false`
3. ProtectedRoute sees `isGuest = true`
4. Children render immediately
5. User can browse entire site
6. No authentication required

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 5: User Logout
**Flow:**
1. User clicks logout button
2. `logout()` calls `signOut(auth)`
3. Auth listener fires with `user = null`
4. All auth states reset to null/false
5. `loading = false`
6. `isGuest = false` set after signOut
7. ProtectedRoute shows welcome screen

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 6: Social Login (Google/Facebook)
**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. `loginWithGoogle()` opens popup
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Auth listener fires with Google user
5. `createUserDocument()` creates/updates Firestore doc
6. New users get `onboardingCompleted: false`
7. Flow continues like normal signup/login

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 7: Error Handling
**Flow:**
1. Network error or Firestore error occurs
2. Error caught in try-catch
3. Error logged to console
4. `loading = false` set
5. All auth states set to null/false
6. User sees welcome screen
7. Can retry without being stuck

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 8: Page Refresh During Active Session
**Flow:**
1. User is logged in and browsing
2. User refreshes page (F5)
3. `loading = true` initially
4. Auth listener fires with current user
5. Firestore document fetched
6. All states restored correctly
7. `loading = false`
8. User continues where they left off

**Result:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### ✅ Scenario 9: Onboarding Modal - Close Without Completing
**Flow:**
1. New user signs up
2. Onboarding modal appears
3. User clicks X button to close
4. Modal closes (local state)
5. User can browse site in current session
6. On page refresh:
   - Modal reappears (onboardingCompleted still false)
7. User eventually completes or skips
8. Modal won't appear again

**Result:** ✅ Works as intended (modal persists until completed)

---

### ✅ Scenario 10: Concurrent Sessions
**Flow:**
1. User logs in on Tab 1
2. User opens Tab 2 → sees logged-in state
3. User logs out on Tab 1
4. Tab 2's auth listener fires
5. Tab 2 shows welcome screen
6. Auth state synced across tabs

**Result:** ✅ Firebase handles this automatically
