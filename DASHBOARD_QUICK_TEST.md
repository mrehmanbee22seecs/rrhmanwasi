# ✅ Dashboard - Quick Test Guide

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

Three major bugs were completely fixed:

3. ❌ **Glitching Stats Counter** → ✅ **Now Stable!**

---

## 🧪 **30-Second Test**

### Step 1: Navigate to Dashboard
```
Click "Dashboard" in navigation
```

### Step 2: Check Welcome Message
```
✅ Should see: "Welcome back, [Your Name]! 👋"
✅ Should see: "Ready to make a difference today?"
✅ Should see: Impact Score in top-right
```

### Step 3: Check Stats Cards
```
Look at the 4 stat cards below welcome message:

✅ Projects Joined: Shows 0-25 (stable number)
✅ Events Attended: Shows 0-15 (stable number)
✅ Hours Volunteered: Shows 0-120 (stable number)
✅ Impact Score: Shows 0-100 (stable number)

❌ Numbers should NOT be:
  - Continuously changing
  - Showing very high values (1000+)
  - Flickering or glitching
```

### Step 4: Check Quick Actions
```
Scroll down slightly

✅ Should see "Quick Actions" heading
✅ Should see 4 cards:
  1. Find Projects (blue)
  2. Upcoming Events (green)
  3. Apply to Volunteer (red)
  4. Get Support (purple)
```

### Step 5: Refresh Page
```
Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

✅ Numbers should remain same
✅ No continuous counting
✅ No glitching
✅ All sections still visible
```

## 📊 **Expected Stats Values**

### For New Users (0-10 activities):
```
Projects Joined: 0-1
Events Attended: 0
Hours Volunteered: 0-25
Impact Score: 0-50
```

### For Active Users (50+ activities):
```
Projects Joined: 5-25 (capped at 25)
Events Attended: 3-15 (capped at 15)
Hours Volunteered: 100-120 (capped at 120)
Impact Score: 90-100 (capped at 100)
```

### Calculation Method:
```
Projects Joined = activityCount / 10 (max 25)
Events Attended = activityCount / 15 (max 15)
Hours Volunteered = activityCount * 2.5 (max 120)
Impact Score = (activityCount * 5) + (interests * 10) (max 100)
```

## 🐛 **If Something Still Broken**

4. **Browser Console**: Look for specific errors
5. **Try Incognito**: Rule out extension conflicts
