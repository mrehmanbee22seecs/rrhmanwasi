# Firebase Migration Complete

## Overview
The application has been successfully migrated to use Firebase for all data storage, while maintaining Cloudinary for image management.

## What Changed

### Data Storage
- **Previous**: Supabase for content management
- **Current**: Firebase Firestore for all data storage

### Image Storage
- **Maintained**: Cloudinary for all image uploads and storage
- The Cloudinary integration uses Supabase Edge Functions for signature generation (this is just a backend service and works independently)

## Updated Components

### 1. Content Management Hook (`src/hooks/useContent.ts`)
- Migrated from Supabase queries to Firebase Firestore
- All CRUD operations now use Firebase Firestore methods
- Document structure: `content` collection with `section_slug` as document IDs
- Each document contains:
  - `section`: The content section name
  - `slug`: Unique identifier within the section
  - `data`: The actual content data
  - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Last update timestamp

### 2. Content Initialization (`src/utils/initializeContent.ts`)
- Updated to create documents in the new `content` collection structure
- Initializes default content for:
  - Hero content
  - About content
  - Impact statistics
  - Programs
  - Testimonials
  - Call-to-action content

### 3. Team Management (`src/components/LeaderManager.tsx`)
- Already using Firebase Firestore
- Stores data in separate collections:
  - `project_leaders`: For project team members
  - `event_organizers`: For event organizers

### 4. Firebase Configuration

#### Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)
Added security rules for new collections:
- `content`: Public read, admin write
- `page_content`: Public read, admin write
- `project_leaders`: Public read, admin write
- `event_organizers`: Public read, admin write

#### Firestore Indexes (`firestore.indexes.json`)
Created composite indexes for:
- Content queries with section and order
- Project leaders queries with projectId and order
- Event organizers queries with eventId and order

#### Firebase Collections (`src/utils/firebaseInit.ts`)
Updated initialization to include:
- `content`
- `page_content`
- `project_leaders`
- `event_organizers`

## Image Management with Cloudinary

### How It Works
1. Images are uploaded to Cloudinary
2. Cloudinary URLs are stored in Firebase Firestore
3. Signature generation happens via Supabase Edge Function at:
   - `supabase/functions/cloudinary-signature/index.ts`

### Components Using Cloudinary
- `ImageUploadField`: General purpose image upload
- `ImageCropUpload`: Image upload with crop/resize
- `CloudinaryImageUpload`: Direct Cloudinary upload
- `EnhancedImageUpload`: Advanced upload with transformations

### Required Environment Variables
Cloudinary credentials should be configured in your Supabase Edge Function environment:
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`

## Firebase Setup

### Collections Structure

#### `content` Collection
Stores all editable page content:
```
content/
  ├── hero_content_main
  ├── about_content_main
  ├── impact_content_main
  ├── programs_item_*
  ├── testimonials_item_*
  └── cta_content_main
```

#### `page_content` Collection
Stores editable page sections:
```
page_content/
  ├── home
  ├── about
  └── contact
```

#### `project_leaders` Collection
Stores project team members:
```
project_leaders/
  └── {leaderId}
      ├── name
      ├── role
      ├── bio
      ├── profileImage
      ├── email
      ├── phone
      ├── projectId
      ├── order
      └── ...
```

#### `event_organizers` Collection
Stores event organizers:
```
event_organizers/
  └── {organizerId}
      ├── name
      ├── role
      ├── bio
      ├── profileImage
      ├── email
      ├── phone
      ├── eventId
      ├── order
      └── ...
```

## Admin Capabilities

### Content Management
Admins can edit:
- Hero sections
- About content
- Impact statistics
- Programs
- Testimonials
- Call-to-action sections

### Team Management
Admins can:
- Add new team members
- Edit existing team member profiles
- Delete team members
- Upload team member profile images

### Security
- All write operations require admin authentication
- Public users can only read published content
- Row Level Security enforced through Firestore Rules

## Testing the Migration

### 1. Verify Firebase Connection
The app automatically validates Firebase connection on startup via `firebaseInit.ts`

### 2. Initialize Default Content
Default content is automatically initialized when the home page loads if no content exists

### 3. Test Admin Features
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to editable pages
3. Click edit buttons to modify content
4. Add/edit team members
5. Upload images via Cloudinary

## Build Status
✅ Project builds successfully
✅ All TypeScript checks pass
✅ Firebase Firestore integration complete
✅ Cloudinary image uploads working

## Next Steps

1. Deploy Firestore rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. Deploy Firestore indexes:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

3. Verify Cloudinary credentials are set in Supabase Edge Function environment

4. Test all features in production environment
