# Email System Build Fix - Summary

## Problem
When deploying to Vercel, the build was showing warnings about Node.js modules being externalized for browser compatibility:

```
[plugin:vite:resolve] Module "url" has been externalized for browser compatibility, 
imported by "/vercel/path0/node_modules/gaxios/build/src/common.js"
```

This was happening because the `mailersend` package (a Node.js server-side library) was being imported directly in the browser code (`src/services/mailerSendEmailService.ts`).

## Root Cause
- The `mailersend` package depends on `gaxios`, which uses Node.js built-in modules like `url`, `https`, `querystring`, `stream`, `net`, `tls`, etc.
- These modules cannot run in the browser environment
- Vite was externalizing these modules, causing warnings and potential runtime issues

## Solution
Refactored the email system to follow a proper client-server architecture:

### 1. Removed mailersend from Browser Code
- Removed `mailersend` dependency from main `package.json`
- Refactored `src/services/mailerSendEmailService.ts` to call backend API endpoints instead of using mailersend directly

### 2. Created Backend API Endpoints
Created 4 new Vercel serverless functions in the `/api` directory:
- `api/send-welcome.js` - Welcome emails on user signup
- `api/send-submission.js` - Project/event submission confirmations
- `api/send-approval.js` - Admin approval notifications
- `api/send-volunteer.js` - Volunteer form confirmations
- `api/send-reminder.js` - Already existed for scheduled reminders

### 3. Updated Frontend Email Service
The frontend service now:
- Uses `fetch()` to call backend API endpoints
- No longer imports any Node.js packages
- Maintains the same API interface, so no changes needed in components

## Benefits
✅ **Clean Builds**: No module externalization warnings  
✅ **Better Architecture**: Proper separation of client and server code  
✅ **Security**: Email API keys only in backend environment variables  
✅ **Compatibility**: Works properly in browser environment  
✅ **Scalability**: Serverless functions can scale independently  

## Files Changed
1. `package.json` - Removed mailersend dependency
2. `src/services/mailerSendEmailService.ts` - Refactored to use API endpoints
3. `api/send-welcome.js` - New
4. `api/send-submission.js` - New
5. `api/send-approval.js` - New
6. `api/send-volunteer.js` - New
7. `package-lock.json` - Updated dependencies

## Testing
All build tests pass:
- ✅ mailersend removed from main package.json
- ✅ mailersend present in api/package.json
- ✅ All API endpoints exist
- ✅ Frontend no longer imports mailersend
- ✅ Build completes with no warnings
- ✅ No module externalization warnings
- ✅ Browserslist updated

## Deployment
The changes are ready for deployment to Vercel. The build will now complete successfully without warnings.

### Environment Variables Required (Vercel)
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `MAILERSEND_API_KEY` - MailerSend API key
- `MAILERSEND_SENDER_EMAIL` - Verified sender email
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Firebase service account email
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Firebase service account private key

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test email functionality in production
3. Monitor serverless function logs for any issues
