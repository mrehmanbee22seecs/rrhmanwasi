## 🐛 BUGS FOUND

### **BUG #1: Donation Widget Hidden on Mobile** 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY

**File:** `src/components/DonationWidget.tsx` (Line 45)

**Issue:**
```tsx
<div className="fixed bottom-4 left-4 sm:bottom-6 sm:left-1/2 sm:-translate-x-[calc(50%+100px)] z-50 hidden sm:block">
```

**Problem:**
- `hidden sm:block` means the donation button is COMPLETELY hidden on mobile devices
- Mobile users cannot donate at all!
- This is a critical business impact bug

**Impact:** 
- 📱 Mobile users: **CANNOT SEE OR USE**
- 💻 Desktop users: **WORKS FINE**

**Fix Required:**
- Show button on mobile in a non-overlapping position
- Consider using a responsive FAB (Floating Action Button) layout

---

### **BUG #2: Potential Button Overlap on Mobile** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Files:** Multiple components with fixed positioning

**Issue:**
Multiple floating buttons on mobile could overlap or stack awkwardly:

```
Mobile Layout:
- ChatWidget: bottom-4 right-4
- DonationWidget: bottom-4 left-4 (currently hidden)
- AdminToggle: bottom-20 left-4 (for admins)
```

**Problem:**
- If DonationWidget is shown on mobile, it will be at `bottom-4 left-4`
- AdminToggle is at `bottom-20 left-4`
- These are only 16px (4rem) apart vertically - might feel cramped
- On very small screens, buttons might overlap

**Impact:**
- 📱 Mobile: Buttons might overlap or be too close
- 💻 Desktop: No issue

**Fix Required:**
- Better stacking strategy for mobile
- Consider a "More Actions" menu button
- Or better vertical spacing

---

### **BUG #3: Z-Index Hierarchy Inconsistency** ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY

**Multiple files with z-index values**

**Current z-index values:**
```
z-50: ChatWidget, DonationWidget, Header
z-[60]: DonationWidget Modal Background, AdminToggle
z-[70]: DonationWidget Modal Content, AdminPanel
```

**Issue:**
- DonationWidget button is z-50
- DonationWidget modal background is z-[60]
- DonationWidget modal content is z-[70]
- AdminPanel is also z-[70]

**Potential Problem:**
- If AdminPanel and DonationWidget modal are both open, they're at same z-index
- Could cause rendering issues or click-through problems

**Impact:**
- Rare edge case
- Only happens if both modals open simultaneously

**Fix Required:**
- Establish clear z-index hierarchy
- Document the z-index scale
