# 🔄 Migration Guide for Admin - Stats System Update

## Overview

The stats system has been upgraded to track **REAL user participation** instead of estimated values. This guide will help you migrate existing data and understand how to manage user stats going forward.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Run Migration (ONE TIME ONLY)

### **Step 1: Login as Admin**
1. Go to your website
2. Login with your admin account
3. Click the "Admin" button (bottom left)

### **Step 2: Navigate to System Tab**
1. Admin Panel opens
2. Look for the tabs at the top
3. Click on **"System"** tab (or "Sys" on mobile)

### **Step 3: Run Migration**
1. You'll see a section: "🔄 Migrate Existing Submissions"
2. Click the **"Run Migration"** button
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-10 seconds)
4. You'll see a success message: "Migration successful! Updated X projects and Y events."

### **What the Migration Does:**
- ✅ Adds `participantIds` to all existing projects (includes submitter)
- ✅ Adds `attendeeIds` to all existing events (includes submitter)
- ✅ Calculates `durationHours` from `durationEstimate` if missing
- ✅ Sets default 2 hours if no duration info available
- ✅ **Does NOT modify any other data**

**Result:** All existing users will now see their correct stats on their Dashboard! 🎉

## 📊 How Stats Work Now

### **For Users:**
All stats start at ZERO and increment based on actual participation:

```
Projects Joined: 0 → Counts approved/completed projects
Events Attended: 0 → Counts approved/completed events
Hours Volunteered: 0 → Sum of actual duration hours
Impact Score: 0 → Calculated from participation
```

### **Stats Update When:**
1. ✅ User creates a project/event → Admin approves
2. ✅ Admin adds user to participantIds/attendeeIds
3. ✅ Status changes to `approved` or `completed`
4. ❌ NOT when status is `draft` or `pending`

---

## 👥 How to Track User Participation

### **Method 1: User Creates Submission (Automatic)**

When a user creates a project/event:
1. User submits via "Create Submission" form
2. User is **automatically added** to participantIds/attendeeIds
3. You (admin) just need to approve
4. Stats update instantly!

**You don't need to do anything extra!** ✅

---

### **Method 2: Add User to Existing Project/Event (Manual)**

If a user joins an existing project/event that they didn't create:

#### **Using Firestore Console:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
4. Find the submission:
   - For projects: `project_submissions` collection
   - For events: `event_submissions` collection
5. Click on the document to edit
6. Add/edit the field:
   - For projects: `participantIds` (array)
   - For events: `attendeeIds` (array)
7. Add the user's UID to the array
8. Save

**Example:**
```
Before:
participantIds: ["user123"]

After (added user456):
participantIds: ["user123", "user456"]
```

#### **User's Stats Will Update Immediately!**

## 🎯 Step-by-Step: Approving Submissions

### **When reviewing a submission:**

1. **Go to Admin Panel** → **"Submissions"** tab
2. Find the submission
3. Click **"Review"**
4. Add admin comments (optional)
5. Click **"Approve"**

**What happens:**
- ✅ Status changes to `approved`
- ✅ Submission becomes visible on website
- ✅ User's stats update automatically
- ✅ User sees:
  - Projects/Events: +1
  - Hours: +[durationHours from submission]
  - Impact: Calculated

---

## 📝 New Field: Duration (Hours)

### **In Create Submission Form:**

Users now see a field:
```
Duration (Hours) *
[Input field for number]
"This will count toward volunteer hours when completed"
```

**Examples:**
- Event: 2.5 hours
- Workshop: 4 hours
- Project: 40 hours

**If user doesn't fill it:**
- System tries to parse `durationEstimate` (e.g., "3 hours" → 3)
- Falls back to 2 hours default

**Admin Tip:** You can edit `durationHours` in Firestore if needed!

---

## 🔢 Impact Score Formula

```
Impact Score = (Projects × 10) + (Events × 5) + (Hours ÷ 2)
```

**Examples:**

| User Stats | Calculation | Impact Score |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 project, 0 events, 5 hours | (1×10) + (0×5) + (5÷2) | 12 |
| 2 projects, 3 events, 30 hours | (2×10) + (3×5) + (30÷2) | 50 |
| 5 projects, 10 events, 100 hours | (5×10) + (10×5) + (100÷2) | 150 |

**This formula is transparent and fair!** Users can see how their impact grows.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### **After Running Migration:**

- [ ] Go to System tab in Admin Panel
- [ ] Click "Run Migration"
- [ ] See success message
- [ ] Check a user's Dashboard
- [ ] Verify stats show correctly
- [ ] Approve a new submission
- [ ] Verify stats increment

### **For Existing Users:**

- [ ] Login as an existing user
- [ ] Go to Dashboard
- [ ] Check if stats show (Projects, Events, Hours, Impact)
- [ ] If stats are 0 but user has submissions, check:
  - Are submissions `approved` or `completed`?
  - Did migration run successfully?
  - Are participantIds/attendeeIds present?

### **For New Users:**

- [ ] Create new account
- [ ] Check Dashboard → All stats should be 0
- [ ] Create a submission (with durationHours)
- [ ] Admin approves
- [ ] Check Dashboard → Stats should increment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: User's stats show 0 but they have approved submissions**

**Solution:**
1. Check if migration ran (System tab → Run Migration)
2. Verify submissions have `approved` or `completed` status
3. Check if `participantIds`/`attendeeIds` includes the user's UID
4. Check if `durationHours` field exists

### **Issue: Migration button doesn't work**

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in as admin
3. Check Firestore permissions
4. Try refreshing the page

### **Issue: Stats don't update after approval**

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh Dashboard (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check if real-time listeners are working
3. Verify Firestore rules allow read access
4. Check browser console for errors

## 📋 Quick Reference

### **Key Fields in Submissions:**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `participantIds` | Array | Users who joined the project |
| `attendeeIds` | Array | Users who attended the event |
| `durationHours` | Number | Actual duration in hours |
| `status` | String | draft, pending, approved, rejected, completed |
| `submittedBy` | String | User ID of creator |

### **Stats Count When:**
- ✅ Status is `approved` OR `completed`
- ✅ User is in `participantIds`/`attendeeIds` OR is `submittedBy`
- ✅ `durationHours` has a value (or can be parsed)

### **Stats DON'T Count When:**
- ❌ Status is `draft` or `pending`
- ❌ Status is `rejected`
- ❌ User is not in participant/attendee list

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Always Fill Duration Hours**
When creating submissions, encourage users to fill the "Duration (Hours)" field accurately.

### **2. Approve Promptly**
Stats only update after approval. Don't leave submissions in `pending` for too long.

### **3. Use Completed Status**
For past events/projects, change status to `completed` to indicate they're done.

### **4. Track Participants Manually**
For group activities, manually add all participant UIDs to the arrays.

### **5. Verify Stats Periodically**
Spot-check a few users' Dashboards to ensure stats are accurate.
