## üéØ Quick Fixes

2. Go to your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

---

### "The reminder was created but email never came"

**Check:**
1. Did you wait until the scheduled time?
2. Check QStash dashboard - was it delivered to your function?
3. Check Vercel function logs - did it execute?
4. Check MailerSend logs - was the email sent?

**Most common cause:** Forgot to redeploy after setting `VITE_QSTASH_TOKEN`

---

### "I'm getting CORS errors"

**This shouldn't happen, but if it does:**
1. Make sure you're using the deployed Vercel URL, not localhost
2. Check if QStash is calling the right URL

## üÜò Still Stuck?

If you've checked everything above and it's still not working:

1. **Check Vercel deployment logs:**
   - Look for build errors
   - Check if API function deployed

2. **Share these logs:**
   - Vercel function logs (from Vercel Dashboard)
   - Browser console errors (screenshot)
   - MailerSend activity log (screenshot)

3. **Verify API endpoint:**
   - Open `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/send-reminder` in browser
   - You should see "Method not allowed" (that's correct!)
   - If you see 404, the function didn't deploy

---

## ‚ú® Pro Tips

1. **Start simple:** Get welcome emails working first, then move to reminders
2. **Check dashboards:** MailerSend and QStash dashboards show everything
3. **Use test emails:** Set reminders 1-2 minutes in future for quick testing
4. **Redeploy often:** After any environment variable change
5. **Copy-paste carefully:** API keys are long and easy to mistype

## üìû Getting Help

When asking for help, provide:
- Which test is failing (1, 2, or 3)
- Screenshot of browser console errors
- Screenshot of Vercel function logs
- Confirmation that environment variables are set

**Remember:** Most issues are fixed by simply redeploying after setting environment variables! üöÄ
