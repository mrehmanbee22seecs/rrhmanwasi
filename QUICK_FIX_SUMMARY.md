# Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Broken
1. ❌ **serverTimestamp() error** when approving/rejecting submissions
2. ❌ **Permission denied** - Admin couldn't see all submissions in dashboard
3. ❌ **Submissions disappeared after refresh**

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Changed `Date` objects to ISO strings in `auditTrail` array
2. ✅ Updated Firestore rules to allow admins to read ALL submissions
3. ✅ Verified `isVisible` field is set correctly on approval

## Files Changed
- `/src/components/AdminPanel.tsx` - Fixed serverTimestamp error
- `/firestore.rules` - Allow admin to read all submissions

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules (REQUIRED)
```
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/wasilah-new/firestore/rules
2. Copy contents of /firestore.rules
3. Paste into editor

```

### 2. Test The Flow
**Regular User:**

## Expected Results After Fix
