# 🤖 Smart Chatbot - Auto-Learning Guide

## Overview

The chatbot is now **smart like ChatGPT** - it automatically learns from your website content without manual feeding! No external APIs, no costs, works 100% on Firebase Spark (free) plan.

## 🎯 What's New

### Before (Manual)
- ❌ Had to manually write and update KB entries
- ❌ Limited to predefined FAQs
- ❌ Couldn't answer questions about new content
- ❌ Required constant maintenance

### After (Smart Auto-Learning)
- ✅ Automatically learns from ALL website pages
- ✅ Discovers new pages and content automatically
- ✅ Updates knowledge base on-demand or scheduled
- ✅ Answers questions about ANY page content
- ✅ Zero cost - 100% client-side processing
- ✅ Works like ChatGPT for your website!

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Auto-Discovery
The system automatically discovers all pages on your website by:
- Scanning navigation links
- Following internal URLs
- Building a complete sitemap

### 2. Content Extraction
For each page, it:
- Uses hidden iframes to load pages without navigation
- Extracts meaningful text content
- Filters out navigation, headers, footers
- Captures headings for better context

### 3. Intelligent Processing
The extracted content is:
- Tokenized and indexed using TF-IDF
- Enhanced with fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
- Enriched with keyword extraction
- Stored in localStorage (zero cost!)

### 4. Smart Responses
When a user asks a question:
- Matches against both manual FAQs AND auto-learned content
- Uses semantic understanding (synonyms, Roman Urdu)
- Provides contextual answers with source links
- Falls back to admin escalation if needed

## 📊 Admin Panel Features

### Access
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to Admin → KB Manager
3. See the "Smart Knowledge Base" panel at top

### Dashboard Shows
- **Manual Entries**: Hand-crafted FAQs (12 entries)
- **Auto-Learned**: Content from website pages
- **Total Entries**: Combined knowledge base
- **Total Tokens**: Amount of indexed content
- **Last Updated**: When KB was last refreshed
- **Cost**: Always $0.00 (Free Forever!)

### Refresh Button

## 🎓 How to Use

```

### For Admins

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check KB Health
1. Open Admin → KB Manager
2. Look at Smart KB Panel stats
3. Verify "Last Updated" is recent
4. Check "Auto-Learned" entries > 0

### Test Chatbot
1. Open chat widget
2. Ask questions about different pages:
   - "What is Wasilah?" (Home page)
   - "How to volunteer?" (Volunteer page)
   - "Tell me about events" (Events page)
3. Verify bot provides relevant answers

### Troubleshooting

#### KB Not Updating
**Problem**: Refresh button does nothing
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear localStorage and refresh page
- Ensure you're logged in as admin

#### Poor Answers
**Problem**: Bot doesn't answer well
**Solution**:
- Improve content on website pages
- Add more headings and structured content
- Refresh KB after content updates

#### No Auto-Learned Entries
**Problem**: Shows 0 auto-learned entries
**Solution**:
- Wait 5 seconds after page load (background init)
- Click "Refresh KB" manually
- Check if pages have enough text content

## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Refresh Frequency
Edit `src/services/autoLearnService.ts`:
```typescript
const daysSince = (now.getTime() - lastUpdated.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
return daysSince > 7; // Change 7 to desired days
```

### Add More Pages to Learn From
System auto-discovers pages, but you can add specific ones in `contentScraperService.ts`:
```typescript
const commonPages = [
  '/',
  '/about',
  '/projects',
  '/events',
  '/volunteer',
  '/contact',
  '/your-new-page' // Add here
];
```

### Adjust Matching Threshold
Edit `src/utils/kbMatcher.js`:
```javascript
export function findBestMatch(query, pages, threshold = 0.15) {
  // Lower threshold = more matches (less strict)
  // Higher threshold = fewer matches (more strict)
}
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- ✅ All processing client-side
- ✅ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ Content stored in user's browser only
- ✅ No personal data collected

### Admin Access
- ✅ KB refresh requires admin login
- ✅ Firestore rules protect admin routes
- ✅ Users can only access public KB data

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Write Good Content**: Clear headings and structured text
2. **Use Keywords**: Include terms users might search for
3. **Keep Updated**: Refresh KB after content changes
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check what users ask about
5. **Improve Iteratively**: Enhance pages based on questions

### Content Guidelines

**Good Content (Bot Loves This):**
```html
<h2>How to Volunteer</h2>
<p>You can volunteer by filling out our application form...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Visit the volunteer page</li>
  <li>Step 2: Fill out the form</li>
  <li>Step 3: Wait for confirmation</li>
</ul>
```

**Bad Content (Bot Can't Use):**
```html
<div class="fancy-box">Click here to do stuff</div>
<!-- Too vague, no context -->
```
