### Firebase Collections Used

1. **users** (existing, enhanced)
   - Added `subscription` field with usage tracking

2. **payment_transactions** (new)
   - Stores all payment records
   - Tracks transaction IDs
   - Enables payment history

3. **admin_notifications** (enhanced)
   - Payment verification requests
   - Manual approval needed notifications

### Firestore Rules

```javascript
// Users can read their own subscription data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow update: if isOwnerOrAdmin(userId);
}

// Users can create payment transactions, admins can manage
match /payment_transactions/{transactionId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || isAdmin());
  allow create: if isAuthenticated();
  allow update, delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Setting Up Payment Methods

1. **Update Payment Account Numbers** in `src/types/payment.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const PAYMENT_ACCOUNTS = {
     jazzcash: {
       number: 'YOUR_JAZZCASH_NUMBER',
       name: 'Wasilah Foundation',
     },
     easypaisa: {
       number: '03349682146', // Already configured
       name: 'Wasilah Foundation',
     },
     // ... other accounts
   };
   ```

2. **Configure Email** for manual payments:
   ```typescript
   email: {
     billing: 'billing@wasilah.org',
     support: 'support@wasilah.org',
   }
   ```

### Enabling Additional Payment Gateways

See `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_GUIDE.md` for instructions on:
- PayFast (for credit/debit cards)
- JazzCash Gateway API
- Easypaisa Gateway API
- International options (Paddle, Payoneer)

## 📊 Admin Management

### Viewing Payments

Admins can view payment transactions in Firestore:
```
Collections → payment_transactions
```

Each transaction shows:
- User ID
- Amount
- Payment method
- Transaction ID
- Status (pending/completed/failed)
- Timestamp

### Manual Approval Flow

1. Admin receives notification in `admin_notifications`
2. Verifies payment externally (check bank/wallet)
3. In Firestore:
   - Update payment status to "completed"
   - Update user's subscription tier
4. User automatically gets upgraded

### Subscription Management

To manually upgrade a user:
```javascript
// In Firestore Console
users/{userId}/subscription
{
  tier: "supporter", // or "champion"
  startDate: <Timestamp>,
  expiresAt: <30 days from now>,
  usage: { /* reset to 0 */ }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Subscription Flow

1. **Sign up as new user** → Defaults to Free tier
2. **Try chat** → See message counter (5 messages max)
3. **Send 6th message** → See upgrade prompt
4. **Go to /pricing** → See all tiers
5. **Click upgrade** → See payment modal
6. **Select payment method** → See instructions
7. **Enter test transaction ID** → Activates instantly!
8. **Check dashboard** → See new tier badge
9. **Try chat again** → Unlimited messages now!

### Test Limits

**Free Tier:**
- Send 5 chat messages → 6th is blocked
- Create 1 project → 2nd shows upgrade prompt
- Create 1 event → 2nd shows upgrade prompt
- Create 3 reminders → 4th shows upgrade prompt

**After Upgrade:**
- All limits removed or increased
- Badge appears everywhere
- Usage stats update

## 🌍 Firebase Spark Plan Compatibility

✅ **Everything works on FREE Firebase Spark plan!**

- ✅ No Cloud Functions required (optional)
- ✅ No paid Firebase features needed
- ✅ All logic runs client-side
- ✅ Uses only Firestore reads/writes
- ✅ Storage not required for subscriptions
- ✅ Works within Spark plan limits

**Daily Limits (Spark Plan):**
- 50K document reads
- 20K document writes
- 20K document deletes
- 1GB storage

Your subscription system uses minimal reads/writes per user action.

## 📈 Analytics & Monitoring

### Track These Metrics

1. **Conversion Rate:**
   - Free → Supporter
   - Supporter → Champion
   - Where users drop off

2. **Revenue:**
   - Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
   - Average revenue per user (ARPU)
   - Churn rate

3. **Usage Patterns:**
   - Which features hit limits most?
   - What triggers upgrades?
   - Most popular tier

4. **Payment Success:**
   - Instant activation vs manual
   - Payment method preferences
   - Failed transactions

### Query Examples (Firestore)

```javascript
// Count users by tier
users where subscription.tier == "supporter"

// Recent payments
payment_transactions 
  where status == "completed" 
  orderBy createdAt desc

// Users who hit limits
users 
  where subscription.usage.chatMessagesToday >= 5
  where subscription.tier == "free"
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Tier Features

Edit `src/types/subscription.ts`:

```typescript
export const SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS = {
  free: {
    features: {
      chatMessagesPerDay: 10, // Change from 5 to 10
      projectSubmissionsPerMonth: 2, // Change from 1 to 2
      // ... other features
    }
  }
}
```

### Changing Prices

Edit `src/types/subscription.ts`:

```typescript
supporter: {
  price: 10, // Change from $5 to $10
  priceDisplay: '$10/month',
  // ...
}
```

### Adding New Tiers

1. Add to `SubscriptionTier` type
2. Add to `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` object
3. Update pricing page UI
4. Update badge colors/icons

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Upgrade prompt not showing

**Check:**
1. User hit actual limit
2. `canSendChatMessage()` returning false

4. Component rendering correctly

**Fix:** Check browser console for errors
