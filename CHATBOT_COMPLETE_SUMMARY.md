within 3-5 business days...

[🔗 Learn more: Volunteer]
```

### Scenario 2: Needs Admin

noted it for our admin to check. You'll get an 
update soon!

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Per 100 Messages
- Reads: ~300 (100 user + 100 bot + 100 KB loads)
- Writes: ~200 (100 user + 100 bot messages)
- Function calls: 0 (unless KB refresh)

### Monthly (3,000 messages)
- Reads: 9,000 / 50,000 daily limit = 18% ✅
- Writes: 6,000 / 20,000 daily limit = 30% ✅
- Storage: ~1MB KB + ~10MB messages = <1% ✅
- Functions: 4 refreshes × 5 sec = 20 sec / 40,000 = 0.05% ✅

**Result: Extremely comfortable within Spark limits!**

## 🎓 How It Actually Works

### The Intelligence
1. **User asks:** "How do I volunteer?"
2. **Tokenize:** ['volunteer']
3. **Calculate TF-IDF:**
   - volunteer in Page 4: 0.95
   - volunteer in Page 1: 0.15
   - volunteer in Page 2: 0.12
4. **Compute cosine similarity:**
   - Page 4: 0.87 ✓
   - Page 1: 0.23
   - Page 2: 0.19
5. **Fuzzy match:**
   - "volunteer" ≈ "volunteer" (100%)
   - Boosts Page 4 score
6. **Final score:** (0.87 × 0.6) + (fuzzy × 0.4) = 0.81
7. **Check threshold:** 0.81 > 0.4 ✓ Match!
8. **Extract snippet:** Best sentence from Page 4
9. **Add source link:** `/volunteer`
10. **Return to user** ← All in <500ms!

### The Auto-Learning
1. **Sunday 2 AM:** Function wakes up
2. **For each page:**
   - GET https://your-site.web.app/
   - Extract HTML text
   - Remove tags/scripts
   - Tokenize words
   - Store in Firestore
3. **Update timestamp:** lastUpdated field
4. **Log results:** Success/failed counts
5. **Done** ← Takes ~5 seconds total

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Add More Pages
```javascript
// functions/updateKb.js line 22
const PAGES_TO_SCRAPE = [
  // ... existing pages
  { url: '/faq', title: 'FAQ' },
  { url: '/team', title: 'Our Team' },
];
```

### Adjust Confidence
```javascript
// ChatBot.jsx line 144
const match = findBestMatch(userMessage, kbPages, 0.4);
// Try: 0.3 (lenient) or 0.6 (strict)
```

### Add Synonyms
```javascript
// kbMatcher.js line 154
const SYNONYMS = {
  // Add your domain terms
  'register': ['signup', 'enroll', 'join'],
  'certificate': ['proof', 'document'],
};
```

### Change Refresh Schedule
```javascript
// functions/updateKb.js line 189
.schedule('0 2 * * 0') // Sunday 2 AM
// Change to: '0 2 * * 1' (Monday)
// Or: '0 14 * * *' (Daily 2 PM)
```
